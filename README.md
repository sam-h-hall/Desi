## Usage

Those templates dependencies are maintained via [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) via `pnpm up -Lri`.

This is the reason you see a `pnpm-lock.yaml`. That being said, any package manager will work. This file can be safely be removed once you clone a template.

```bash
$ npm install # or pnpm install or yarn install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

You can deploy the `dist` folder to any static host provider (netlify, surge, now, etc.)

# Desi!

This is a tool that will allow designers and developers to collaborate together more easily.

Designers can create styles and themes for each project, which can then be imported to the site

Developers focus on logic, designers focus on design

Use Desi plugin (future) to add comments, ask questions, collaborate with each other seamlessly

Developers can write documentation, upload, and edit components

-- design components, import them into projects, devs only need to manage logic
  - easier translation from design to develop
  - upload componenets to be easily distributed 
  - write documentation
  - custom animation tool
  - plugin for comments between devs/designers
